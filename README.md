# TwoPlusTwo
What is two plus two?

Programming project examples using variety of languages.

Would like to have window pop up with "Two plus two equals four." on all,
and a simple "OK" button to close. 

It is a great learning opportunity for me to see how the code works, differences
in the code, and just a fun time learning to program.

Enjoy!
